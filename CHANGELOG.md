# ZFS Mirror Setup Script - Change History

## v5.1.3 - PATCH: Fixed GRUB kernel detection with dynamic runtime detection (2025-10-03)

**Critical Fix for GRUB First-Boot Entry Generation**

Replaced compile-time kernel detection with runtime detection to eliminate "No kernel found" failures during installation.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The script was trying to detect the kernel version during GRUB script generation (in chroot context) rather than at boot time. This caused failures because:
- Installation context: Kernel detection runs in chroot where filesystem paths differ
- Boot context: GRUB finds kernels correctly in the actual mounted filesystem
- Timing issue: Kernel detection during installation vs. when GRUB actually needs it

**Bug Fixes:**
- FIXED: "Warning: No kernel found in /boot/ or /boot/@/" during installation
- REPLACED: Static kernel detection with dynamic GRUB-time detection
- ELIMINATED: Context-dependent filesystem path issues in chroot environment
- IMPROVED: More robust kernel detection that works regardless of installation environment

**Technical Changes:**
- **Kernel Detection**: Moved from script generation time to GRUB boot time
- **GRUB Entry**: Uses dynamic for-loop to find available kernels at runtime
- **Path Resolution**: Eliminates dependency on chroot filesystem context
- **Error Handling**: No more kernel detection failures during installation

**User Impact:**
- Eliminates installation abortion at "configuring_first_boot" stage
- GRUB first-boot entries are created successfully regardless of chroot environment
- More reliable first-boot force import mechanism
- Reduces installation failure rate significantly

**Files Changed:**
- zfs_mirror_setup.sh: +12 lines, -16 lines (dynamic GRUB kernel detection)

## v5.1.2 - PATCH: Fixed chroot kernel detection order and systemctl failure handling (2025-10-03)

**Critical Bug Fixes for Installation Completion**

Fixed two critical issues that prevented successful installation completion: incorrect kernel detection order in chroot context and unhandled systemctl failures.

**Bug Fixes:**
- FIXED: Kernel detection trying `/boot/vmlinuz-*` before `/boot/@/vmlinuz-*` in chroot context
- FIXED: Script exit on systemctl enable failure due to `set -euo pipefail`
- IMPROVED: Added proper error handling around systemctl commands with graceful degradation
- ENHANCED: More accurate error reporting for service enablement failures

**Technical Changes:**
- **Kernel Detection**: Reordered fallback chain to check `/boot/@/` first in chroot environment
- **Error Handling**: Wrapped critical systemctl commands with conditional execution and fallback logging
- **Service Management**: Script continues even if cleanup service fails to enable (manual cleanup documented)
- **Installation Flow**: Prevents premature exit during final configuration steps

**User Impact:**
- Eliminates installation failures at 95% completion due to service enablement issues
- Ensures GRUB first-boot entries are created with correct kernel paths
- Provides graceful degradation when systemd services can't be enabled in chroot
- Reduces need for manual recovery procedures

**Files Changed:**
- zfs_mirror_setup.sh: +7 lines, -2 lines (error handling and kernel detection order)

**Git Hash**: [To be updated after commit]

## v5.1.1 - PATCH: Enhanced installation state tracking and fixed GRUB kernel detection (2025-10-02)

**Improved Installation Reliability and Diagnostics**

Enhanced installation state tracking for better failure diagnosis and fixed GRUB kernel detection issues that could prevent proper first-boot force import configuration.

**Bug Fixes:**
- FIXED: GRUB kernel detection failing with "No kernel found in /boot/@/" during first-boot setup
- IMPROVED: Kernel detection with multiple fallback methods (direct path, ZFS path, dpkg query)
- ENHANCED: Installation state tracking with 5 additional granular checkpoints for precise failure diagnosis

**Technical Changes:**
- **State Tracking**: Added `pools_creating_datasets`, `configuring_system`, `chroot_configuration`, `finalizing`, `configuring_first_boot` states
- **Kernel Detection**: Multi-path fallback system handles both filesystem and chroot environments
- **Error Reporting**: More accurate failure state reporting instead of misleading "pools_creating" errors
- **GRUB Generation**: Robust kernel version detection prevents first-boot configuration failures

**User Impact:**
- Eliminates "No kernel found" warnings during GRUB generation
- Provides precise failure location when installations encounter issues
- Ensures first-boot force import mechanism works reliably
- Better troubleshooting information for installation failures

**Files Changed:**
- zfs_mirror_setup.sh: +9 lines, -3 lines (state tracking and kernel detection improvements)

- **GRUB Sync**: Fixed regex to handle zpool status output format (no /dev/disk/by-id/ prefix)
- **GRUB Sync**: Added logic to reconstruct full device paths from zpool device names
- **Drive Replacement**: Applied same device path fixes for consistency

**User Impact:**
- Eliminates "No ZFS mirror drives found" GRUB sync failures
- Prevents EFI partition corruption that made mirror drives unbootable
- Ensures both drives maintain proper UEFI boot entries with distinct names
- Provides man page access in base installation

## v5.0.0 - MAJOR: Simplified First-Boot Force Import with Enhanced Safety Features (2025-10-01)

**Simplified Approach: Replaced Complex Hostid Synchronization + Added Safety Features**

Replaced the complex hostid synchronization approach (v4.x) with a simpler first-boot force import using Ubuntu's ZFS initramfs implementation, plus added safety features.

**Major Changes:**
- REMOVED: 60+ lines of complex hostid synchronization, byte order manipulation, timing validation
- REPLACED: With ZFS native `zfs_force=1` kernel parameter approach
- ADDED: Auto-cleanup systemd service for seamless transition to clean imports
- ADDED: 10-second countdown timer for `--prepare` flag with CTRL+C abort capability
- IMPROVED: Documentation with complete flow from live CD to post-first-boot
- ENHANCED: Comprehensive command-line flag documentation

**Technical Implementation:**
- Research-based: Analyzed `/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/zfs` source code
- Uses ZFS kernel parameter `zfs_force=1` (sets `ZPOOL_FORCE="-f"` in import logic)
- GRUB integration with self-removing `/etc/grub.d/99_zfs_firstboot` script
- Systemd service `zfs-firstboot-cleanup.service` handles automatic cleanup
- Non-blocking countdown using `read -t 1 -n 1` for immediate key detection
- SIGINT trap handling for clean CTRL+C abort with proper exit messaging

**Safety & User Experience:**
- Eliminates "pool was previously in use from another system" errors permanently
- Clear 10-second warning before destructive operations begin
- Flexible abort mechanism (CTRL+C) or immediate continuation (any key)
- Risk-based confirmation prompts remain unchanged
- Comprehensive validation test procedures included

**Files Changed:**
- zfs_mirror_setup.sh: +677, -204 lines (net +473)

### Phase 6: Critical Hostid Fix (Sep 29)
- **v4.2.0**: **CRITICAL BUG FIX** - Hostid synchronization implementation
- **v4.2.1**: **VALIDATION FIX** - Fixed premature hostid validation timing
  - Moved chroot validation from before pool creation to after base system install
  - Added dual validation: early file check + final comprehensive validation
  - Resolves "Hostid synchronization failed!" error during installation
- **v4.2.2**: **MOUNTPOINT FIX** - Fixed hostid directory conflict with ZFS pool creation
  - Moved hostid file copy from before pool creation to after pools are mounted
  - Prevents "mountpoint '/mnt/' exists and is not empty" error during rpool creation
  - Resolves ZFS altroot conflict with pre-created /mnt/etc directory
- **v4.2.3**: **DUAL VALIDATION** - Belt-and-suspenders hostid validation with DRY refactoring
  - Created reusable `validate_pool_hostid()` function with robust zdb parsing
  - Early validation: before base system install (fast failure, save time)
  - Final validation: at installation completion (comprehensive verification)
  - Unified error handling and debug output for consistent troubleshooting
- **v4.2.4**: **ZDB FIX** - Fixed hostid validation for active/imported pools
  - Replaced `zdb -C poolname` (fails on active pools) with `zdb -l device` (works always)

  - Fixes "Expected: 79a07734, got rpool: c4634" type validation errors
- **v4.2.6**: **CRITICAL HOSTID BUG** - Fixed chroot hostid reading to use synchronized file instead of hostid command
  - Root cause: Line 2045 called `hostid` in chroot context, returning installer hostid instead of target system hostid
  - Fixed by reading from `/etc/hostid` file directly using hexdump instead of hostid command
  - This was the actual cause of "pool was previously in use from another system" errors on first boot
  - Target system ZFS config now uses correct synchronized hostid, enabling clean imports without force flags
- **Problem**: "pool was previously in use from another system" errors on first boot
- **Root cause**: Pools created with installer hostid, system boots with different hostid
- **Solution**: Generate hostid before pool creation, synchronize to target system
- **Impact**: Eliminates need for force flags and first-boot cleanup complexity
