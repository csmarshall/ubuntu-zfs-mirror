## Major Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Creation (Sep 9)
- **aaf4217**: Initial 2436-line script created
- Full ZFS mirror installation capability
- Basic Ubuntu 24.04 support

### Phase 2: Early Enhancements (Sep 10)
- **a63f8c7**: Added 436 lines of functionality
- **7d80022**: Minor 26-line improvement
- **2739bd1** & **04da7dd**: Quick bugfixes (single lines each)

### Phase 3: Feature Expansion (Sep 11)
- **fcac35f**: Added 138 lines of new features
- Enhanced functionality and error handling

### Phase 4: Major Refactor (Sep 12)
- **2fd8e33**: **MASSIVE CHANGE** - Removed 1589 lines, added 828
- Net reduction of 761 lines while improving functionality
- Major code cleanup and optimization
- **f1f4a1f**: Single line bugfix post-refactor

### Phase 5: Production Hardening (Sep 24-26)
- **f89cafe**: 48 additions, 34 removals - code improvements
- **a791119**: "Fixed sync script" - 31 additions, 20 removals
- **cefe2ae**: "Additional care and support" - 320 additions, 25 removals

### Phase 6: Critical Hostid Fix (Sep 29)
- **v4.2.0**: **CRITICAL BUG FIX** - Hostid synchronization implementation
- **Problem**: "pool was previously in use from another system" errors on first boot
- **Root cause**: Pools created with installer hostid, system boots with different hostid
- **Solution**: Generate hostid before pool creation, synchronize to target system
- **Impact**: Eliminates need for force flags and first-boot cleanup complexity

## Key Observations

### Script Evolution Pattern
1. **Initial Version**: Large, comprehensive script (2436 lines)
2. **Expansion Phase**: Added features and functionality (+436 lines)
3. **Refinement**: Small fixes and improvements
4. **Major Refactor**: Dramatic cleanup (-761 net lines) while maintaining functionality
5. **Production Focus**: Enhanced reliability and support features

### Development Velocity
- **Most Active Period**: Sep 10-12 (5 commits in 3 days)
- **Major Refactor**: Sep 12 - Removed 65% of lines while improving functionality
- **Recent Focus**: Production reliability (Sep 24-26)

### Current State (Post cefe2ae)
- Approximately 2,700+ lines of code
- Production-hardened with "additional care and support"
- Enhanced sync script functionality
- Ready for sharing and distribution

## Technical Insights
